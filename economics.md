# Introduction to macroeconomics
Scarcity = "the state of being scarce or in short supply; shortage." (rarity)

Dichotomy between scarce resources vs free resources

**Economics = how do we allocated scarce resources.**

## Examples: 
Caviar = a scarce resource
Labour = a scarce resource
Water = a scarce resource
Air = a free resource (it is a seemingly infinite resource)

## Normative and positive statements
- Normative statement = a statement that is a matter of opinion (subjective).
- Positive statement  = a statement that is testable.

"Paying people who aren't working, even though they could work, is wrong and unfair." -> Normative statement.
"Programs like welfare reduce the incentive for people to work." 		      -> Positive statement.
"Raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for government programs grows the economy."      -> Positive statement.
"Raising taxes on the wealthy slows economic growth." 			 	      -> Positive statement.
"The government should raises taxes on the wealthy to pay for helping the poor."      -> Normative statement.

## Economic models
Complex real world systems can be modelled by using simplifying assumptions.

## Command and market economies
Command economies e.g. communist states.
-> the goverment controls the factors of production
-> e.g. goverment commands the production of 10^4 cars, 10^6 apples.
-> notions of fairness and equality.

Market economies e.g.
-> factors of production are independent of the goverment.
-> products are sold at variable rates in market.
-> notions of competition / inequality.

Spectrum: Market economy <--- Mixed economy ---> Command economy

In reality economies tend to be mixed.

# Opportunity cost and the Production Possibilities Curve

## Production possiblities curve

What can be caught in a given day; ceteris paribus?

| Scenario | Rabbits | Berries |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| A        | 5       | 0       |
| B        | 4	     | 100     |
| C        | 3       | 180     |
| D        | 2       | 240     |
| E        | 1       | 280     |
| F        | 0       | 300     |

>Plot the above and you have a production possiblities frontier.

All possible scenarios are contained under the curve.
Points outside the curve are not possible.
Optimal scenarios exist on the curve.

## Opportunity cost

Opportunity cost is the trade off for moving along on the PPF.

The marginal cost is the opportunity cost of 1 unit.
